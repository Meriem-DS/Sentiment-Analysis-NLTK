4.3 out of 5 stars,"
  Super disappointed when I got this phone. I rarely leave reviews but when I opened this phone I was aggravated. Screen has scratches and the outside edges of the phone are dirty. This is clearly not a refurbished phone, so it should not be advertised as such. Now I have to wait for another one which is even more aggravating!

  I purchased a refurbished iPhone x, it arrived on time, came in clean , and with a charger.... i was excited about this phone because my other phone was stolen 3 months ago, i got a job and saved up to be able to afford a new one. We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price)  trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could

  This IPhone X has been phenomenal. The speed at which it operates is Incredible. If you are questioning this buy, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a wonderful deal. I‚Äôve not had one issue thus far, and will most certainly update this review if I have one within the warranty period. I recommend getting a tempered glass screen and a good case‚Äîthis phone is glass front and back.

  I loved how new this phone looks and works. Everything works and the battery life was at 94% which is very good. I am very glad with this purchase and definitely recommend buying from them. Very skeptical before buying but now having the product it is definitely worth a buy if you are looking for a good phone.

  I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream. Only minor inconvenience was having to update the phone before I could download the backup from my old phone. Came fully unlocked as promised and with an off brand charger that works fine.

  I picked 2 day shipping to get it delivered 5 days later. Upon receiving I tried to power it on. To no response. I went  to charge it on the charger that was given to get the charging screen for 30 minutes. I then used my other charger for 4 hours to no results. The quality of charger and charger brick was very poor. Did not come with EarPods. I sent it back Now I hope I get my refund quickly for amazon guarantee.

  While the phone looked perfect and seemed as if it functioned well, it would not connect to  carrier that it says it is made for- Verizon, despite being advertised as being unlocked for Verizon Service. I have a traditional monthly (NOT a pay as you go account). I was very disappointed. The only option offered was to return it for a refund."
5.0 out of 5 stars," I have sent the seller a message and requested they send me a replacement device. That is a shame. :( For those who question my knowledge, I took it directly to Verizon and they also tried multiple sim cards in it and none worked. The phone continued to display NO SERVICE. They went through all of the normal fixes and could not get it to function properly. I will update this review if a MIRACLE occurs and I am suddenly able to get service.

  So before I made this purchase, I read through a lot of reviews on a lot of different sellers who had iPhone X's for sale. This one seemed to have the most consistent positive stream of reviews, although every single listing I came across had at least a few people reporting bad experiences. Buying something Amazon Renewed seems like it's always a risk, so I suppose you may have a bad experience, but the phone I received came on time, and was essentially in flawless condition. It came with a tempered glass screen protector already on, and the battery health was at 92%, supporting peak performance capabilities. The cameras are crisp, no damage to them at all, and the speakers sound great. No SIM/WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity issues whatsoever, and really I was pleasantly surprised at how great this phone is. The only thing was that in a couple of the crevices on the phone, chiefly around the camera's protrusion, there was a tiny bit of dirt/grime, but a toothpick and alcohol did the trick. Overall I would say this is a great purchase, as iPhone X's are currently going for $899+tax (new) from Best Buy, and this was almost new for $559+tax (~$611). Would recommend!

  LOVE! THOUSAND TIMES LOVE! I was skeptical at first when selecting to buy this iPhone, I took time into reading all the comments and seeing as there was more positive reviews then negatives I went ahead and bought it. The entire phone is in BRAND NEW condition, no scratches or blemishes! The battery life was said to be 80% mine on this phone is 99% maximum capacity! I am very pleased with how well this turned out to be! I did however not rate the fingerprint ID because it is facial ID not fingerprint."

  The phone was reported STOLEN AND WAS SHUT OFF BY ATT. THIS SELLER IS A SCAMMER. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. Straight out of the box the phone had A LOT of scratches both on the screen and back of the phone. Pretty disappointed, knew the phone was coming at a discount but it‚Äôs basically already ready for a screen replacement. The phone itself is super glitchy, can‚Äôt even sign in to my WiFi on the next screen. It also does not come with any original box nor headphones. One after market, cheap phone charger included.

  My iPhone 6 started having battery problems so I decided to replace  it. Was going to go to a new 7 or 8, but saw I could get a fully restored X on Amazon for about the same price. Easy to set up. I honestly feel like it‚Äôs a new phone. The first thing I checked was the battery health and it was 100%! Everything functions perfectly. Love the Face ID. Great camera and sound. Once you get used to no home button, you won‚Äôt miss it. Without it the screen fills the whole phone. So the overall phone size is not too big, but you get more screen size - a win win in my opinion. So far I am presently satisfied.

  Great Deal for an almost new unlocked iPhone X. Mine had some scuff marks on the side of the phone and on the top. Please see my photos I‚Äôve included.  But my phone case covers all the marks- so no worries. Mine had a battery life value of 85% which is OK, wish it were better. But it will do! It‚Äôs 100% UNLOCKED. It worked no problem for Metro PCS. (Cost me $15 to activate at metro) But so far NO ISSUES with this iPhone. I will come back and edit if I run into any issues. I‚Äôve had this for about a month. Works great!

  I have had the phone for several days now. Everything functions perfectly - camera, battery life, speakers, face recognition, etc., and it looks brand new. I read several reviews that mentioned that you can‚Äôt turn the camera click off - no problem here. And there was no issue getting it set up with our service provider (Sprint). When considering buying this phone based on reviews, consider a few things: this is hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying one new, Amazon‚Äôs return service is impeccable so if worst comes to worst, just return it and get another one, and also consider the fact that on average only roughly 10% of people even bother writing Amazon reviews and that a majority of the people leaving 1 star reviews probably wouldn‚Äôt have written a review at all if everything checked out like this phone did (I almost forgot to write a review myself). Then consider the fact that a majority of reviewers gave the phone 5 stars and you begin to see how if you‚Äôre interested in saving money this is an excellent route as you‚Äôre not likely going to do much better than this for the money.

  My iPhone 5S performance was deteriorating and I decided to upgrade by getting this phone. I have Straight Talk by TracFone Inc. a GSM carrier, and received a refurbished iPhone X that was from Verizon and was able to insert my SIM card without any interruption of service.

  The screen has a very noticeable scratch on it. In addition, the battery health is at 83%, which is ridiculous considering this is a X and my 6S+ battery is still at 90%.

  I purchased a Premium Renewed iPhone X. The item arrived in a shrink-wrapped Renewed branded box. There was a lot of information inside to help me understand more about the Amazon Renewed Guarantee which allows me to return this Premium item for up to one year if anything goes wrong. I've had the phone for two weeks now and love it. It might as well have been a brand new phone. Battery health is 100%. The camera is incredible (a BIG step up from my old 6S). I highly recommend this!

  The item came exactly as describes so there is no complaints! The battery life span was at 92% when it came so hopefully that‚Äôs good. Everything is working great! The phone is in good condition with no flaws. However, it doesn‚Äôt have as long as a battery life as my old iPhone 7 does and it runs out of battery much quicker. BUT that may just be the iPhone x itself and it is as expected since it‚Äôs more complicated than the iPhone 7 so it may need to use up more battery life. I don‚Äôt really know. But other than that the phone is really good and I would definitely recommend this seller.

  I love iPhone. I love this iPhone. However, the screen had 2 very minor scratches that my friend noticed on it. I couldn't even see them so I'm not upset about that. I AM upset that the phone was supposed to come with at least 80% of battery. Mine had 79%.  I did not return the phone because I had planned to replace the battery even at 80%, which cost me $50. It's just disturbing to buy from someone who promises to follow the Premium policy and simply does not. Other than that, the phone is working well, and I love it. Maybe try buying from a different seller.

  As soon as the product arrived I tested it and see what went wrong, I am surprise but also disappointed in the same time. So here are my pros and cons about the item;"
5.0 out of 5 stars, Pros :
4.0 out of 5 stars,"What I love the most about it is the touch screen, I was very surprise how the touch screen works perfectly smooth, the battery life is great and the screen so crispy clear."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Cons :
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Since the seller didn't provide the real picture of the item so It's very disappointing to find out that there are tiny scratches around the camera as you can see from the picture 2. It is not noticeable but it's not acceptable for me. Also it's not fully unlocked. Why ? Because I tested to make a phone call using my SIM card (Total wireless) it seems to work with LTE, however the internal speaker is very deep as in the other voice of the person I was talking to is very far although it's already on the highest volume."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Then me and my husband tried to use his phone to call my number, but unfortunately it didn't work, so I thought maybe we have to be a little bit further, then he went outside while I'm inside calling using his phone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"But again it didn't receive anything. As you can see on pic 1, it went to a voicemail meanwhile the iPhone didn't show anything. But I didn't take a pic of this iPhone received the voicemail notification on inbox."
5.0 out of 5 stars,However I didn't try using speaker or headset so I have no clue about that.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"ALSO, the most annoying thing is that I tried to call their customer service and  I spoke to one of them over the phone regarding my issue but she didn't bother to ask what would be the issue about the item etc instead she refused to help me create a shipping pick up label for UPS and persistently saying that they only provide UPS label for drop off. As I explained my situation that we do have stay home order but she only saying that I can request pick up service and other shipping services but it'll be in my cost, she was also mentioned that I can return the item when the stay home order is over, which I don't know when. Then again she refused to help me to create the shipping label for UPS pick up. In the end she hangs up the phone on my face. When I report it to the seller via message box the other customer service completely ignore my concern."
4.3 out of 5 stars,"
  Please read before buying: My phone has been holding up great after a month of using it. Only problem is my phone was made for the Japanese/Chinese market and my camera shutter sound won‚Äôt turn off. Other than that... Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I‚Äôd say that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it‚Äôs a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i‚Äôve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn‚Äôt been entirely paid off. Also, their ‚Äúrefurbishments‚Äù aren‚Äôt really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There‚Äôs only one problem that really isn‚Äôt that big of a problem. But please, if you really want a good quality phone for around this price, check with your carrier and see if they have some discounted phones or refurbished phones that are actually refurbished. Better safe than scammed.

  My wife and I have been looking for new iPhones, but didn't want to live with another two year contract with Verizon, So I looked around for used/renewed iPhone X's and found this seller. Buying a renewed iPhone so far is the way to go. No two year contracts with cellular provider and a practically a new iPhone with lots of memory. I would at this high recommend this company for purchasing renewed iPhone X.

  It came in a plain white box with a functional charger (not original) and no headphones. The phone was covered with a clear plastic and had really minor scuffs (barely noticeable, I used a bright white light to search for scratches) at the base of the phone around the speaker and charging port. I would describe the appearance as excellent."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"No issues with setup. I tested camera, video call, video recording, phone call, touch screen and Bluetooth connectivity to fitbit, speakers and car. Everything worked fine. Works like a new phone. Battery health is at 84% (I wish it was over 95%) but it works much better than my old iPhone and I'll replace the battery in time if it does not hold charge. It got a bit hot while using it which I'll assume had to do with the phone consuming a lot of data from the installation and setup process."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This phone was purchased for use in Trinidad & Tobago on bmobile network. It connected easily without an issues therefore the phone is unlocked as stated. This was my first 24 hours with the phone and I'm very pleased with this renewed purchase. Synergy was the only seller that I found with little negative reviews and I am glad and feel relief that I chose this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update April 2020: With regular FaceTime use I realised that that is a minor flaw with the camera. The screen has intermittent black flashes that last for a second.

  I‚Äôm not going to lie, reading the reviews i was really sketched. To me it seemed like there was a 50/50 chance you could get a bad phone. But I can only speak for me personally and it‚Äôs an almost perfect phone that I recieved. Not a single scratch and even came with the glass screen protector on there. The battery was at 91% which I wasn‚Äôt fond of but if that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs wrong with it, I‚Äôll take it for the price. But I went in with the mindset that if I get a bad one, I can just keep sending it back till I get a good one, but the one I got is almost flawless. I love the phone. So don‚Äôt pay attention to the reviews, it‚Äôs a great phone and hey, if you get one that‚Äôs not in great condition, Amazon is great at returns.

I got this item on time, a little disappointed that the phone was a bit dirty, had a screen protector installed (but dirty) and slight scratches on the screen and back glass.

  On September 9, 2020 I purchased an Apple iPhone X 64 GB factory unlocked smartphone. The price for this unit was $429.99. I was able to transfer the contents of my iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. The iPhone X worked for approximately a week, and then I went into a black screen mode. I Googled repairs and then contacted the Apple site to see about making the black screen go away. Nothing worked! I finally took the phone to my Apple Store in the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester New Hampshire and the technician took the phone into the back room. The technician came back and informed me that the phone worked but the display did not. The display was aftermarket, not an Apple product. But for an additional $270+ I could have an Apple display installed. No thank you!!! I‚Äôll return the phone to Amazon. The Apple technician stripped the iPhone X of all information and returned it to its original new in the box state."

  This product (Apple iPhone X from MobileSpree) seems to deliver as promised from user reviews. Following additional user reviews from YouTube, the device appears to still be installed with an Apple Certified OLED screen and I was unable to observe any screen burn-in. I am a little disappointed that iOs software indicates Battery Health is at 84% Maximum Capacity, but this still meets the promise from Amazon Refurbished devices of being at least >80%. I did not see any blemishes or scratches; thought the device had a polished screen, I noticed a little grime (probably oil residue from hands of previous owner) along the power and volume buttons."

  I bought this for my Wife for her birthday in January to replace her iPhone 7. Neither she or I are tech nerds and couldn‚Äôt care less about having the latest and greatest when it comes to phones. We both have used the iPhone platform for at least a decade, so naturally, we stick with it due to the familiarity with the operation and use of these Apple products."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little worried about when reading reviews as some people loved this product and others complained about scratches and imperfections. The one I received was flawless. I didn‚Äôt see a single scratch or blemish on it. The battery was dead when it arrived, but quickly fired up after being charged for a few minutes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life seems fine, even though the battery life feature says that it had a max of 86%. My wife hasn‚Äôt had an issue at all with it draining in an inordinately fast manner and she used it a lot."
3.0 out of 5 stars,She especially likes the privacy feature in which the screen isn‚Äôt visible to others from the side.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Since she and I both aren‚Äôt keen on the facial recognition feature that replaced the Finger ID on this phone, she just uses the 6 digit passcode to unlock.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone does everything my wife wants it to do and arrived in absolutely pristine condition. The box is generic, there are no ear buds with it and the lightning cable and block are also generic. None of these make any difference to her since she has Bluetooth ear buds already and we have about a dozen blocks and cables already. The seller made it clear what would come with the phone, so we were already okay with that."

  1. Has notable scratches on the back and the sides. Infact a sticker on the box says ""bad back and body"" !!. 2. Battery health is at 93% which is not great but ok I guess.However while charging touch screen goes nuts and can't use the touch screen properly ! And also if i try to use the phone while charging the battery level drops (while charging) as well ! Hence i'm pretty sure this has a bad battery.3 The charging cable / charger I got with the device is not from apple and the cable doesn't even work.. 4 The phone gets super hot within like 5 mins after light use... Overall I'd say not to purchase this. It's not worth the money and it's not ""refurbished"" for sure.. These are used devices with defects

  Worst experience...do not buy! Four months after purchasing, apps started freezing and every time we attempted to make a call, the phone would reboot and the call would drop.  Contacted Amazon and they contacted the 3rd party vendor (Kiss Electronics) and it went no where since they only back the phone for 3 months.  Spent hours with Apple support and we did a factory reset which was unsuccessful in fixing the problem.  They also did a remote diagnostic check and found no issues?  They said, I could ship the phone to them to have their technicians work on the phone, but the estimate cost for that service was $918...who would ever spend that?  I conclude this ""Kiss Electronics"" knows they are selling garbage and Apple does not want you to fix phones as they would rather see you elect to trade in for a more expensive option.  I guess this is a $400+ lesson to not buy a ""renewed"" phone ever again through Amazon!

  I've never written a review for anything but I had to this one time to make sure others don't go through what I go through on a daily basis. From the moment I turned it on, sometimes the screen wouldn't light up but it would still react to touch. It would only unlock on the first try maybe 30% of the time. Few months later the touch screen isn't working while still not lighting up on the first try of trying to unlock it. I bought this phone a month before the pandemic started and I work at a grocery store and I'm also a college student so I didn't have the time and also couldn't risk going without a phone for however long it would take them to send me a new one. And when I did make an effort early on to return it they were very unclear and broad about their instructions. Also the calling line did not even work. I would not risk buying one of these phones from this company again, horrible phone that gives me problems every hour of the day and cost me so much inconvenience and horrible customer service. Do not buy from them.

  Phone was in Pristine condition. Phone worked as expected. This is absolutely a REAL IPHONE X. This is NOT A FAKE. It does not come in a apple box, however it did come with a screen protector and a black silicone case. There was no charger as explained in the description. I only returned it due to it being a little to small of a screen compared to the one my husband has now which is the iphone 7plus. If it would have been for myself I would have absolutely kept it. Picture was amazing, fast as heck too. So I HIGHLY recommend this seller and am willing to say they are trustworthy devices. Seller also replied in a timely manner to answer my question in reference to possibly exchanging it.

  I bought two of these phones one came with 100% battery life and the other one came with 95% battery. Everything on the phone looks new. Hardly no scratches at all. The one phone came almost dead and the other with a little less then half charged. And on the one phone it looks like there is a screen protector on it but it‚Äôs just the screen raised for what ever reason it‚Äôs not coming off it just looks like it has a thick glass screen on it. But other then that these two phones seem really nice for being refurbished phones.

  This iPhone X works just the way it was created; all features are available to me with the AT&T network compatibility.  Next time I would get an unlocked compatible with all carriers, GSM, but this is no problem for me right now.  As an Android user all my life I decided to join the crowd and have a phone easy to use.  I was quarantining so i had 6 days of YouTube and apple online docs to teach myself how to use and the tricks to make it more efficient.

  The phone came without blemish.  Everything looks great and the storage is eligible.  The screen looks good however, there is a device wide fault to these models which causes ghost texting.  It will take over your phone and become very frustrating trying to use or even place a call.  I contacted Apple Care to fix the problem as I saw it was common for this device.  I was told because this retailer is not an authorized Apple retailer that I would have to pay for the repair.  I would suggest that you purchase from an authorized dealer.  The warranty plan with this phone only says for accidents and not defects.

  The only reason it‚Äôs gets a 4 and 3 for battery life is because the battery says it‚Äôs at 92% which is good, but it still dies rather quickly and I wish it would at least have a 20% charge by the end of the day, but it‚Äôs been dying before the sun goes down.. a little disappointed there. The hardware is great, the screen is a beautiful, thanks to Apples collaboration with Samsung, and even with the couple scratches on the screen (I hardly ever notice them) the phone itself is WELL worth the buy maybe not such a high price would have like it lower for the buy but all around a great phone from Apple.

  Refurbished Suddenly stopped working after a few days.  It lost all bars and connection to phone service signal.  Zero bars.  Put my SIM card in another phone, which worked great.  Took it to an Apple store, they said I bought a defective phone.  I‚Äôve bought many refurbished phones, but I simply do not recommend this particular seller.  Also, be fully aware of their outrageous restocking fees that are not pre disclosed when ordering!!  Also, expect several weeks for your refund (whatever amount that is, it varies based upon their interesting criteria which no other seller has that I‚Äôve seen).  That‚Äôs how they make money off selling junk phones.

  I took a gamble ordering this phone I wasn't feeling the negative reviews but the positive reviews outshine the negative. I was prepared when opening my package so I recorded myself doing so in case something went wrong during transit but it was in good condition and looks brand new. facial rec. doesn't always catch on the first try but oh well I gave 4 stars cause of that. battery was at 73 when I figured out how to check it idk what percentage it goes up or if it dies down as you use it usually it charges 100% with my other phones but I'm charging in hopes it charges to higher percentage. not too sure why they ask me to rate battery life. but 4 stars is good enough. id put 5 stars if it charged 100% obviously. overall its worth the money for me you have my approval. gang

Not one scratch, or any type of damage to the phone. It was perfectly wrapped in the protective plastic like a standard iPhone out of the Apple Store.

There are no damages that I can spot and it came almost fully charged. I was able to plug it in and restore my last back up from my 6s plus very quickly. Installing my sim card was easy as well because it came with a little tool specifically for opening the slot. There was a charger and wall piece provided as well. Not an apple brand charger but a charger non the less. Everything seems to be running smoothly and I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase. The iPhone X is a great phone. I love the camera quality and the facial recognition. Not having a home button was weird at first but now it‚Äôs just second nature and actually makes the interface feel more smooth.

  This ""refurbished"" unit was sent to me from CellCow. Upon setup I was unable to click on many options and was generally having trouble navigating. Once I was able to make my way to the home screen I immediately went in to the notes app to test for areas where the screen wasn't receiving touch input. Sure enough, when trying to draw one continuous scribble inside of notes I discovered an obvious rectangle in the middle of the screen that wasn't registering any sort of touch. Aside from this dead zone the phone would also register a bunch of false input and do all sorts of crazy things without me even touching the screen."

  I pulled the trigger on this with some trepidation based on a few of the horror stories in the reviews.  The price point and the return policy made it irresistible.  I'm glad I did.  My wife has essentially a brand new iPhone X for less than 50% what we would pay on apple.com or really any other refurb source I could find.  There is the tiniest of blemishes on the touch screen, and the battery maxes out at 85% of original capacity.  Both are well within the ""as-advertised"" parameters, and to be expected with a phone that's a few years old.

  Unfortunately I am unhappy with this phone thus far because it was delivered LOCKED and therefore not useable. I have messaged the seller and am waiting for a reply which I‚Äôm sure is forthcoming. My frustration really stems from the fact that this is the third iPhone I‚Äôve ordered since September and all three have been a problem and unusable. Phone #1 was also locked so returned and reordered fro Amazon but a different seller; the 2nd phone seemed fine for a few days then froze because it was water damaged from a prior owner- also returned, then # 3 reordered , Amazon, new vendor again- this phone is locked too though it also was advertised and ordered  as UNLOCKED. I am sheltering at home due to Covid-19 and have to send a helper out to Sprint to attempt to get service and also to the post office for returns as the 2nd Seller would not issue a pick up authorization. There was a charge of approximately 12$ for postage on that item which definitely should not have been my responsibility. This is not an inexpensive item and I am very disappointed in the process thus far!

  The phone works just fine. Mine arrived with a battery life of 85%. The phone is not damaged, although I believe the screen on it is a replaced screen, the touch screen is finicky..and the screen itself seems raised. My iphone 6s the screen is smooth within the phone but this screen goes above the border of the phone if that makes sense? It's like taller than the border surrounding the phone..maybe thats how iphone X are..idk. Sometimes certain letters stop working, or I can't hold down when taking a video because it lifts off even if I didn't lift my finger..so I am always sure to use it in a hands-free mode when recording. I mean for $400 I can't complain. Pretty sure I paid more for my iphone 6S when it first came out and I bought it straight from the apple store lol. So I believe I got what I paid for.

Next I removed the SIM from the 6 and installed it in the X. This entire process is doable by anyone who has used a smartphone.

It took maybe 20+ mins to update & I didn‚Äôt know how to transfer all my Apple Music over at once & just ended up manually going through all my albums to redownload them (I have over 2,000 songs lol) overall I‚Äôm overly satisfied with my purchase!!!!!!

  I ordered the phone and it worked well for a few months until it started the dreaded ‚Äúghost touch‚Äù. I took it to the apple store as they have a program to fix it for free as it is a known hardware issue. They would not fix it for less than $279 because there were third party parts. I contacted the seller (within the 90 days) to find out the next steps and they suggested a few rests to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem. By the time I did the ‚Äúfixes‚Äù and the ghost touch came back, I was told it was too late to return and now I am stuck with a phone that types and changes screen on its own. Needless to say I am unhappy with this customer service as it is clearly spa defect that is known and that I had nothing to do with and it is being held to some ridiculous warranty although it was brought to the attention of the seller before hand. I can‚Äôt help but feel like I have been duped. The cosmetic parts of the phone were great, it‚Äôs the hardware that is the issue.

  I sent this phone back.  It would lock up; need to be re-booted to get out of apps.  It would take my news app and shuffle items on the fly like it was a deck of cards ... it would do the same with my photos.  Unlike other Amazon returns, I had to wait until this phone got back to the seller and then wait again while they checked it through, which tied up my money for longer than I appreciated.

  I would say overall it is pretty good. Was in good shape ascetically and the battery lasts a long time. However, the internet connection issues are really annoying. It will randomly go from full bars to zero for no reason. I have to put it in airplane mode and then wait a minute and take it back out of airplane mode. This usually does the trick and it goes right back to full service.  Sometimes I do have to to restart it to get it to pick back up service. This happens everywhere and multiple times a day so it is not a service availability issue, just a connection with the phone issue.

  It worked for a few months. I did not even own it for a year and it started to have problems. The letter ""I"" on the keyboard did not work. Texting and text speech did not work at all so I could not communicate over the phone other than calling someone. Apps open and closed on it's own. It played random videos on youtube that I did not clock on. It would try to download videos or apps on it's own. It would close me out on apps that I had open. The browser no longer loaded pictures on the screen. I contacted the support team, they said warranty was expired and to fix it myself with the help of repair shop. I loved the camera quality so much so it was horrible and inconvenient for me to let this phone go just because the screen was no longer responsive.

  I purchased this phone because I thought it would be a cheap (ish) way to upgrade my phone. I was wrong. After transferring my data and SIM card from my old phone to this phone, it never fully activated because the phone was not fully unlocked as advertised so I never gained LTE/cell service. I went to Verizon and they see it all the time. I spent 2 hours at Verizon trying to undo the damage and get a new (working) phone. Save yourself the headache. Buy a phone new or one from your carrier.

  I am so disappointed.  Upon receiving the phone I thought it was amazing, all the functions worked 100% and there was not a single scratch anywhere. I went into Sprint to get my amazing new phone set up, and once I got there they said it wasn't compatible with Sprint. I guess I thought ""fully unlocked"" meant compatible with any carrier, but I was wrong. The IMEI number to this phone was not compatible with my carrier and there was no way to fix it. Sadly I ended up returning it. Overall the phone is in great condition, just be careful about whether or not it is compatible with your carrier.

  The iphone 10 came with all the stuff it said it would come with. (charger.) Battery life was good. Charges well. Pretty good phone. The only problem was when I spoke on the phone. I could barely hear the caller but the caller could hear me. I had to always put the phone on speaker to hear the person calling. Which isn't too bad, but if your in an open area, it can kinda be annoying. But its not too bad because its advised for people not to put phones very close to ears anyways because of radiation."

  Wouldn't read sim card. Tried multiple sims to see if it was an issue with an individual sim. Went and got a new sim from at&t just in case. Was supposed to be a Christmas gift, so I'm glad I opened it early to test before wrapping it. That would have been awful to gift someone a broken phone. The seller issued a refund quickly.

  I bought this phone to replace my iPhone 6. The battery life on this does not last as long and it seems to be very glitchy. Sometimes my screen will have various colored lines through it  or it gets stuck or frozen for no reason.  I assume this is because I bought it refurbished but I should have just gotten it now .

  I got this phone thought it was great and all and then one day it turned off. Brought it to the Apple store. Guess what they said, the phone had a Chinese fake screen and so the day it randomly turned off now it‚Äôs too late to return.... so basically i spent my hard earned money on a 400$ phone from Amazon with a Chinese screen and the phone will not turn on anymore and cheapest fix is almost 275$...

  Ok, so I was a little afraid buying this because of the reviews left by others, but let me say, the phone I received was AMAZING, no scratches whatsoever, like NONE. I don't know what happened with others, but I received an amazing iPhone. Comes in bubble wrap and comes with a 3rd party charger and wall-brick, it could've used better shipping materials though considering its a $500 phone. I would definitely buy again for sure!!

  i bought my phone about a month ago, so i can safely say that it is in good working condition and there aren‚Äôt many glitches. However, there‚Äôs a part of the touch screen that doesn‚Äôt work at all, and the screen is not very sensitive. I have to press the screen hard to select something or type a message. This was disappointing and challenging to adjust to this, and hard to use when part of the screen does not let me select it. However, the battery life has proven sufficient so far.

  The phone LOOKED ok. It kept powering off and back on. Not showing the correct battery percentage. Just not working. Ended up buying a new one for 200 more. Worth it. Still awaiting a refund.

  Product came with a broken LCD screen.. definitely not worth the price. They must use some cheap screens or something, or perhaps it‚Äôs even a hardware issue.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing I would point out was that the max battery life on this device is only 87%. I knew that going into the purchase so it's not a surprise or a concern of mine. Overall, the trade off for battery life is well worth the $$$ that I saved if I were to buy a new phone.

  I did a lot of research into buying a refurbished phone and looked into sellers on amazon. I have had this Iphone X for 4 months and it has stopped working completely. The Phones charging port no longer works and the phone will overheat, shut off and get stuck with only the logo on the screen. This is especially upsetting seeing as how it was not safe to go to the post office and most public places were shut down during the warranty period of buying this phone. I was unable to return within the limited time frame allowed. Do not purchase anything from this seller or a refurbished item from amazon at all.

  I‚Äôve bought plenty refurbished phones/renewed phones, usually that means a used phone with a new front glass. To my pleasant surprise both sides of the glass appear to be new.  But I was extremely surprised to see a 100% life battery. The stainless steel casings by Apple are very durable in comparison to their aluminum no damage as expected. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt bet on receiving an essentially new phone but that what I got.

  I liked that it came exactly as it descripted, The quality was brand new and came with a little charger to give it battery life. I was able to create a new itunes account, as well as imessage other iphones, set up find my iphone. It is the ios version that includes the new apps current so I got all the free apps to work on the store, and the camera worked just fine. I was able to use the new live wallpaper video feature and I was able to download my previous bought songs from itunes.

  Ordered a 256 GB for AT&T. Product came with minor scuffs on the sides of the phone that were easily covered by a cheap case. IMEI was clean and I just slid in the SIM card from my old iPhone to get signal. Battery life was at 85%. Solid 8/10 quality but well worth the discount over buying new. Will update if any issues arise.

  ¬†The condition of the phone itself was good, but the phone operations were poor. The touch screen Would not work for the upper half of the phone as you can see in the video.

  I just got this phone 5 days ago, and on the second day already, it won't charge past 2%, and then it dies. I took it on a trip and was barely able to use it. Good thing I brought my old cracked phone with, otherwise I wouldn't have a phone at all. I tried charging it for hours and it would just repeat the cycle of turning on up until 2%, and then dying again. Super disappointing because it is a cute phone."

  The initial review of the phone seemed in good condition, battery life was not bad but quickly went downhill - unable to last an entire day.  When the phone is low power mode the screen goes black.  Literally black making the phone useless until significantly charged.  Characters on phone are mixed up. You type a comma and get a period and vice versa.  Disappointed in the quality of this device and the price!

All and all my first experience buying a refurbished device from amazon was actually pretty decent and cool the wait wasn‚Äôt long , I saved $345 by buying here instead of with my phone company, I also found some great deals on cases if I ever needed to use it again I definitely would.

  I was nervous at first because I bought the phone and then read the reviews. However, my phone has been great and working great. No cracks or scratches. It came with a charger and a case.

I can only talk on the phone and hear audio if I have headphones or a Bluetooth device connected. If these are guaranteed like-new, then how does a problem like this get past inspection?

  Got the phone yesterday, beside a little scratch on the front screen, the phone looks great, just like brand new. Batter life is at 89%, this could be better but I‚Äôm ok with it. It came with a pre-installed screen protector that it‚Äôs a bit wide placed, but it‚Äôs a not a issue. The value for the money is 11/10

  After spending time reading the reviews I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would work with Verizon. When I received the phone I popped in my sim and worked perfectly. The phone had minor blemishes... nothing to be concerned with... what you would expect with a refurbished phone. I‚Äôve had the phone for almost a month and everything is working great! Overall I would recommend.

  Everything was okay except for the fact that the middle left of my screen literally did not work. You either had to violently press the screen or don‚Äôt do whatever it is you are trying to do.

  Such a headache. It would turn on fine, the facial recognition worked, the touch screen worked, but it would NOT connect to the network. Just go to Verizon (or whoever your carrier is).

  Love the iphone 10. Probably should have bought it new.

  Came safely. No scratches at all. Was able to set up from old phone in less than an hour and have everything running smoothly. This phone is a little bit bigger than the iPhone SE I previously had and I love the feel of it so far. No glitches and the SIM card installed without a hitch. Definitely will buy again if I have the money and need it!üòÇ  Battery life is at 100%.

  Have ordered the 64G iPhone from this page and had no problems, but when I received the 256G iPhone the touch screen would receive ""ghost clicks"" and made it nearly impossible to use. Further research shows that this is most likely a hard ware issue . Kind of a coin toss on the quality you will receive. Waiting for return request to be approved.

  I bought the unlocked iPhone, but it does not work with my Operator Card: The SIM card you have now installed in this iPhone belongs to a carrier that is not supported by the activation policy. Then I checked the IMEI. Here's what I read: This device is listed in the international blacklist. Will my phone no longer work? Sorry for the mistakes, I live in Ukraine

  Screen or software is still broken. Phone freezes up or starts clicking and opening random things on the phone and locks you out on whatever you are doing. Maybe I just got a bad phone but definitely not worth the price and will be returning.

  The phone came with a preinstalled screen protector, which was neat, and had fade scratches on the back. The stainless steel on the sides has a decent amount of scuffs, which is predictable for its price. But the phone functionality is great judging by the 100% battery life which I am amazed with. All in all it‚Äôs a pretty decent purchase.

  STAY AWAY From APPLE products! When Apple‚Äôs Marketing Chief Phil Schiller gave his blessing to the iPhone X, ""So if you happen to be hanging by the pool, drop your phone in the water... don't worry, dive down, grab it, rinse it, let it dry, you'll be fine.‚Äù"
5.0 out of 5 stars,You would *Think* Apple would stand by its product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"WRONG! As it happened to me, I stopped my phone in shallow water, only 3 feet deep, for a few seconds, and IMMEDIATELY my phone bricked. I purchased my iPhone X for $1199 and I would expect my phone would last a few years and have the peace of mind that my phone would still work after that incident. Well I was more than angry when Apple would not even attempt to replace my product, but charges me $549 to replace with a $#%$ refurbished product. The Staff at genius bar were snobby and would not even care!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"You work hard for you money, you spend your hard earn dollars for a good quality product, but APPLE is only scamming you and stealing from you!"

"

  Phone worked fine for about 30 days. Then the screen went out, went to replace the screen and found stripped out screws as well as the speaker not being married to the motherboard. The protective filament was not removed during assembly therefore caused the phone to overheat amd fry the LCD. No repairs were able to be done to fix it. So I'm out 500$ AND my phone still doesn't work. Would NOT suggest getting phone here. Second time I've had issues. Really hope I can get a refund or replacement.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I could not in all honesty recommend this company to anyone! I purchased this phone from them with the earpiece speaker nonfunctional. I didn‚Äôt call to complain because I couldn‚Äôt send it back/be without, my bad. But the Face ID stopped working as well as the front facing camera, needless to say just out of the 60 day warranty I was instructed to take it to Apple which I did that also verified those facets  were in fact not functioning at all, or even showing up on the test. After the company told me sorry a thousand times they insisted that there was nothing that they would do, so I took it upon myself to inspect the device and found parts missing and the third rate (might be oled) panel causing the problem. Placing a call to the company again netted more sorry‚Äôs and no service. They wouldn‚Äôt even talk about getting me replacement parts.

  Don‚Äôt buy the iPhone X, complete piece of garbage. Face recognition only works 20% of the time, the battery drains within two hours, I always have horrible service even though the person next to me is on the same plane with the same company and has four bars while I have one. He obviously does not have an iPhone X. Siri completely sucks don‚Äôt even try to use it. It is a very slow phone, to be honest I can‚Äôt think of one positive.

"

  Well, it works. I had gotten this phone is a gift, and I am disappointed, microscratches on the front and back (the phone I'm using can't get those on camera) and scuffs on the stainless steel band (see pictures included) and this phone is NOT referbished and if it is, they did a crappy job. It feels like they bought a fair condition iPhone off of eBay and resold it for up to 100$ more than they paid for them. Everything is working though. I recommend that you pay 20-30 dollars more to get a actually referbished iPhone and maybe a 256gb model if you can get one before they go out of stock at 461 dollars.
"

  Bought a WHITE iPhone X as a gift! I waited anxiously for them to open it and they received a IPhone X model that doesn‚Äôt turn on at all.

  I have bought 2 of these 'renewed' iPhone X's and both have been great! I don't buy new iPhones due to the price point, and I will continue to buy these from Amazon. Highly recommended if you don't mind having a phone one or two generations old. Both phones came with screen protectors already on them. They may have had minimal scuffs on them, but nothing I even notice once the case is on.

  I called AT&T this morning to see if this phone can be unlocked and whether it truly came from a non-USA affiliate of AT&T.  Mary, the AT&T representative tol me that:"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A) 250 days remain on the warranty, so phone is about 3-4 months old;"
1.0 out of 5 stars,B) phone is one of many purchased from AT&T (USA) on a payment plan that was not paid;
1.0 out of 5 stars,C) the account used to purchase the phone was closed by AT&T's FRAUD TEAM;
5.0 out of 5 stars,"D) the phone DID NOT come from an AT&T affiliate, European or otherwise;  and"
3.0 out of 5 stars,E) the phone is subject to being blacklisted for non-payment and *possible* fraud.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I provided a copy of my Amazon.com invoice to document that I purchased the phone in good faith.  Mary submitted a request to have this phone ""cleared"" in their system so it won't be blacklisted and can be unlocked.  It will take 48-72 hours to find out if AT&T will do this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Apparently, there are a lot of phones like this one being sold on Amazon.com and other online marketplaces.  Buyer beware.  Do you really want to spend $1,000 + of your hard-earned money only to find out you were scammed?

  I ordered iPhones from two different suppliers with mixed results and returned both. Although I returned them because I ordered the ""all carriers version"" (A1865) and received the GSM-only version (A1901), my main issue was the variation in what ""new from arms length"" means. One phone I received was truly almost new looking. Just one small scratch on the screen and what looked like some pry marks inside the bezel, I'm guessing from replacing the glass, but the second phone I received was trashed, the back was scuffed, the bezel was badly scratched and all was easily visible from arms length.

  The seller had excellent customer service and helped me along the way throughout the whole process. When I had questions they were able to call me and answered them all over the phone like I requested. I had problems with the first phone screen but they were more than happy to help me exchange for a new one. They also took time to specialty look over my second phone to make sure I receiver a nice one. They were extremely helpful in every way. the first product must have been a random mistake that it didn't work. Great company and bought from them again.

  Coming from an iPhone 6, this phone is amazing! I bought this phone because the ones on the Verizon website were totally out of budget. This is a perfect phone for people who are up to date, like more screen, and like new features and nice looking phones. I can not reassure you that your phone will not come with a few small scratches. You have to remember that this is still a RENEWED phone. It will not come as completely new!!!  The person who had MY phone is not the same as the person who might get YOUR phone. But just get it- it's amazing!

  I've always bought from the vendor Chubbiestech and had nothing but good experiences. When my girlfriend needed a ""new"" phone I knew who to buy from. I noticed some of the reviews from other vendor will be on other vendors listings. I guess they categorize by product and not by seller. I can vouche for is vendor and has always been reliable. Its hard to know who to buy from when the reviews are about the products and don't ever mention the vendor. If you do your research you know what you're going to buy just depends from who.

  I have purchased several refurbished iPhones and maybe I‚Äôm just lucky but I‚Äôve had nothing but good experiences.  So far my luck is holding, and this phone looks great, I was hard pressed to find any scratches, looks about new.  The battery life / ‚Äúhealth‚Äù reading gives it 85% residual capacity, so I know it‚Äôs been used a fair bit, but for the price I gotta say that‚Äôs what I call good value. The switch over from the previous phone was flawless and painless.  Will update if it poops out.

  Not sure if it has to do with the model of the phone or the quality of the refurbishment... however my phone seems a bit sluggish. The battery life is not what I would have expected it to be (not performing to standard) and the screen is not as smooth and responsive as I would have expected. In all, I should have stayed with my 7... I just thought I'd upgrade.

  ¬†This phone is amazing and has a beautiful display! I got it two days ago on January 28th. It has amazing battery life compared to my previous phone, the iPhone 7. I have maybe only charged it two or three times since I‚Äôve gotten it. This phone has so much storage, especially to me because I upgraded from 32gb to 256gb. The face recognition works really fast and I love the bright display. It came fully unlocked as mentioned in the description for the phone. My phone company is MetroPcs or Metro by T-Mobile. The only thing I was really nervous about was that the battery health was at 88%. But the description also mentions meeting the requirements of at least 80% battery health. This phone has no scratches whatsoever ever which was what I was really scared about because I spent good amount of money for this phone. I went through the seller HybridIT. The phone got here in three days. I ordered it on January 25th and got it on January 28th. I hope that I could have helped with any concerns or questions that anyone is having while deciding to purchase this phone!!

  I had been thinking it was getting time to upgrade my iPhone 6, but was not excited about paying $800 - $1000 to do it.  Then I bought and Apple Watch Series 3, and discovered the iOS required by the up-to-date watch wouldn't run on the phone.  (We'll leave out my feelings about that surprise.  Tech marches on.)  Anyway, I am really enjoying this iPhone X and it's innovations.  Thought giving up the home button might be a problem, but it's not.  Face recognition works much better than finger print recognition ever did.  Though the phone came in a generic box, with a non-apple charging block, it was otherwise flawless.  Happy to trade the box and block for the hundreds saved over the price of a new phone.  (Seller was Kiss Electronics).

  Bought this phone about 10 months ago. Finally writing this review because the phone has been slightly defective since I got it and I'm sick of it. It's had bad ghost touch glitches on the bottom of the screen which means that the phone thinks that you're touching it even if you aren't. Apps close and open by themselves and it's been getting pretty annoying. I can't spend more than 2 minutes on my phone without the ghost touch acting up.

  Read the bad reviews and decided to give it a try anyway since I bought my last phone refurbished or 'renewed', whatever we're calling it these days and that one was fine.  So far so good.

  Cannot recommend getting one of these phones enough. It came way earlier than expected and is in near perfect condition. I wasn‚Äôt expecting the battery percentage to be 90%, but it is! The only thing about this phone is the speaker on the front sounds pretty bad, but not a deal breaker at all considering this is a three year old phone. The iPhone X is still a great premium feeling phone in 2020 and will be supported by apple (software wise) for a few more years.

  It‚Äôs basically an iPhone and you basically get an iPhone. The drawback is for some reason they sent me a phone with only a 78% battery capacity. As soon as I got it I charged it up to where it claimed it was 100% charged but when I went into settings and checked the battery capacity it was only 78%. I wish there was a way for Amazon to force vendors to be more honest with battery capacity of the phones they sell. If they had been honest and told me the battery capacity was only 78% I would not have bought this item

  The refurbished iPhone X looked like new. However, there were some serious issues. Some icons would not open, the screen kept jumping around and the zoom window kept reappearing.

  I don‚Äôt know what was renewed or refurbished. Phone came with scratches on the screen and battery health of 84. Not sure I‚Äôd recommend buying anything from seller Kiss Electronics. Phone is functional tho and glad battery replacement is simple.

  Arrived in a plain box with a cable and nothing else, some of us appreciate minimal packaging. At an AT&T store, they were able to associate this phone to the network in a few minutes. Battery only charges to 92%, but for the price, fair enough. This phone arrived without a blemish and preforms without flaw.

  All the bells & whistles for half the price of a ‚Äúnew‚Äù one. Came with a screen protector on it & 98% battery health. Couldn‚Äôt have done better anywhere. Completely unlocked & ready to rock. FaceID works flawlessly & so did everything else- as advertised.

  Do not buy from this seller. Phone it trash.  If they would have tested for a few hours they would have know.  Screen fades to red and black frequently.  Then needs to be unlocked to get screen back.  Don‚Äôt buy from here

  Decent, and far cheaper than anything, but when I received it, the listening part of the phone when you make calls is always muffled. Didn't come with all accessories or book as noted, but it would have been nice to get.
"

  I was really nervous this would be noticeably used but it was in such great condition upon arrival. Not a scratch in sight and it works like a charm. Love buying used! It came with an aftermarket charger but I don't mind and the battery life was about 85% so it's still very good. I highly recommend if you want to save money and try out the iPhone X.
